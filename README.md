LFA projects:

Implemented DFA, NFA, Lambda-NFA automatons according to Formal Languages and Automata Theory course - word checker

# Project 2
Implemented DFA and NFA classes, Lambda-NFA to NFA transformation, NFA to DFA transformation, DFA minimization method using POO concepts.

- Implemented the CYK algorithm that gets a conext-free grammar in Chomsky's Normal Form and checks if a word is accepted by the grammar or not.
- Implemented the Pushdown Automata that checks the acceptance of a word.
